#### Thanks for reading! You're busy and I need to get back to writing code so here's my :octocat:❤  quick pitch:
<br />

> #### Sponsor me through GitHub to:
> - #### Validate my contributions to others
>   _I contribute to many projects: [adding features][], [participating in bounties][], and [fixing bugs][]._
> - #### Fund my _gratis_ work
>   _I love building [tools][] and [gadgets][] that others can benefit from._
> - #### Unlock a _force multiplier_ that activates when I in turn sponsor developers that inspire me and build the things that I :heart:
>   _🚀_

### 🗣️ About Me

I live in <span title="also, 🌵">☀ Arizona</span> with my five wonderful children. I've been passionate about Open Source software since I taught myself programming as a kid. If I see something broke, I fix it, that's how I've always been.

I am employed full-time at @americanexpress. <span title="I enjoy the culture at Amex that confronts bias and inequality, champions diversity, and contributes to Open Source." >I contribute to the organization's GitHub repositories and also work on internal projects that I hope to open source.</span>

### 🙇🏽 Thank You

I appreciate your sponsorship! Thank you for helping me to realize my goals and remain active in the community.
